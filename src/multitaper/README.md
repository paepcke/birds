## General Information 
This folder contains the Python implementations of the multitaper spectrogram analysis described in the paper ["Sleep Neurophysiological Dynamics Through the Lens of Multitaper Spectral Analysis"](https://prerau.bwh.harvard.edu/publications/Physiology_Bethesda_2017_Prerau.pdf)<sup>1</sup>. Multitaper spectral estimation, which was developed in the early 1980s by David Thomson<sup>2</sup> and has been shown to have superior statistical properties compared with single-taper spectral estimates<sup>3,4</sup>. The multitaper method works by averaging together multiple independent spectra estimated from a single segment of data. The innovation of the multitaper method is that, instead of using a single-taper function to compute the spectrum, it uses multiple taper functions called discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS). Because DPSS tapers are uncorrelated with each other, they can be averaged together as if they were independent trials of the same condition, producing a spectrum with reduced variance compared to periodogram and single-taper estimation.

## Usage
multitaper_spectrogram_python.py utlizies numpy operations, contains no for loops or list/dictionary comprehension, and includes optional multiprocessing, making it a fairly fast implementation of the multitaper spectrogram analysis.

---

multitaper_spectrogram_python usage:
```
spect, stimes, sfreqs = multitaper_spectrogram(data, fs, frequency_range, time_bandwidth, num_tapers, window_params, min_nfft, detrend_opt, multiprocess, cpus,
                                               weighting, plot_on, clim_scale, verbose, xyflip):
```

<br/>

## Example
In this example we create some chirp data and run the multitaper spectrogram on it.
```
from multitaper_spectrogram_python import multitaper_spectrogram  # import multitaper_spectrogram function from the multitaper_spectrogram_python.py file
import numpy as np  # import numpy
from scipy.signal import chirp  # import chirp generation function

# Set spectrogram params
fs = 200  # Sampling Frequency
frequency_range = [0, 25]  # Limit frequencies from 0 to 25 Hz
time_bandwidth = 3  # Set time-half bandwidth
num_tapers = 5  # Set number of tapers (optimal is time_bandwidth*2 - 1)
window_params = [4, 1]  # Window size is 4s with step size of 1s
min_nfft = 0  # No minimum nfft
detrend_opt = 'constant'  # detrend each window by subtracting the average
multiprocess = True  # use multiprocessing
cpus = 3  # use 3 cores in multiprocessing
weighting = 'unity'  # weight each taper at 1
plot_on = True  # plot spectrogram
clim_scale = False # do not auto-scale colormap
verbose = True  # print extra info
xyflip = False  # do not transpose spect output matrix

# Generate sample chirp data
t = np.arange(1/fs, 600, 1/fs)  # Create 10 min time array from 1/fs to 600 stepping by 1/fs
f_start = 1  # Set chirp freq range min (Hz)
f_end = 20  # Set chirp freq range max (Hz)
data = chirp(t, f_start, t[-1], f_end, 'logarithmic')

# Compute the multitaper spectrogram
spect, stimes, sfreqs = multitaper_spectrogram(data, fs, frequency_range, time_bandwidth, num_tapers, window_params, min_nfft, detrend_opt, multiprocess, cpus,
                                               weighting, plot_on, clim_scale, verbose, xyflip):
```
Here is the resulting spectrogram

## Reading in EDF Data

Many times, medical signal data are stored in EDF files. There are several packages in Python to read in EDF files and below we illustrate one method of loading a single channel of EEG data from an EDF file containing several signals.


```
from pyedflib import highlevel  # to install this package using pip: 'pip install pyEDFlib' 
                                # to install this package using conda: 'conda install -c conda-forge pyedflib' 

signals, signal_headers, header = highlevel.read_edf('test.edf')  # reads in the signal data, header for each signal, and the overall edf header from test.edf

C3_data = signals[2]  # in this edf the 3rd signal is data from the C3 electrode (look at signal_headers to determine the label for each signal in your edf)
C3_fs = signal_headers[2]['sample_rate']  # Extract the sampling frequency for the C3 signal

# C3_data will be the 'data' argument to multitaper_spectrogram
# C3_fs will be the 'fs' argument to multitaper_spectrogram

```

<br/>

## Parallel Processing
The multitaper_spectrogram function makes use of Python's 'multiprocessing' package. To utilize multiprocessing, pass the 'multiprocess' argument as True and set the 'cpus' argument to the number of cores you would like to use for multiprocessing. Note that if you do not provide the 'cpus' argument, but the 'multiprocess' argument is True, the function will automatically use all cores available minus 1. Also, note that if the 'cpus' argument exceeds the number of available cores, the function will default to using all available cores minus 1. Lastly, note that if you choose to use all available cores, your machine will not be able to do anything else while the function is running (because all cores will be in use by the function).
